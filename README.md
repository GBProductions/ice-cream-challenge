## Instructions by Garrett Brown

The user can test all three solutions by either:

 1. Unstriking each solution individually at a time (Delete all "//" or select all code and press [CTRL + C + /] ) and testing the code in Live Server through 

 OR

2. Unstriking each solution individually at a time (Delete all "//" or select all code and press [CTRL + C + /] ) and pasting the code in the Browser Console.

For my three solutions, I used a forEach Loop, a for Loop, and a for... of Loop. If you would like me to submit different possible solutions, please let me know. 

Thank you!
